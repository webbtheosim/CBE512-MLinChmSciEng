        "\n",
        "The final project is fairly open-ended and flexible, but there are two primary restricts. irst, the topics are expected to have some reasonable engineering or chemical/physical/biological science content; if you want to do something that is not firmly scientific in nature, then we will hear you out, but you will have to make the case for its relevance. Second, *you must also utilize some unsupervised learning algorithm* as part of the project.\n",
        "Note that the latter restriction does not preclude you from using supervised machine learning in your project.\n",
        "For example, you may use unsupervised learning to simply analyze your data  or  leverage it in feature engineering/data preprocessing.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this assignment, you need to identify a reasonable germ of an idea.You have considerable flexibility in how you would like to approach the project, although it should likely be done in consultation with the instructors. This assignment is part of that process. We encourage you to discuss with Prof. Webb and/or Bruce via other means even prior to submission of this assignment. Usually the discussion will help focus your efforts.\n",
        "\n",
        "You may base the project on existing or novel/generated data. You may implement (or invent?) an algorithm from scratch, in which case it is advisable to use some fairly simple data to validate the implementation. You may choose to focus on treatment of data or utility of an algorithm (either those that have been covered in class or those that we did not).\n",
        "You may pitch something exploratory. To this point, it is not expected that all projects will \"work.\" Rather, we should have some expectation/hypothesis that they *could* work.  In such circumstances, your report can contextualize the results and potential shortcomings; there is a lot to learn from \"failure.\"\n",
